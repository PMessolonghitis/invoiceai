Hey r/freelance!

I'm a fellow freelancer and I got tired of:
1. Paying $15-30/month for basic invoicing
2. Using ugly Excel/Word templates
3. Tools that require 30 min to figure out

So I built InvoiceAI - a simple invoice generator that lets you:
- Create professional invoices in under a minute
- Save client info for quick invoicing
- Track payment status
- Download PDFs or share links

The free tier gives you 5 invoices/month (no credit card required), which is enough for many freelancers.

Would love your honest feedback. What features would make this more useful for your workflow?

I built a tool that solves a problem I had as a freelancer: invoicing.

Every tool I tried was either:
❌ Too expensive ($15-30/month for basic features)
❌ Too complicated (30+ min learning curve)
❌ Too ugly (hello, Word templates)

So I created InvoiceAI.

It does one thing well: creates professional invoices fast.

Features:
• Create invoices in under 60 seconds
• Save client info for quick repeat invoicing
• Track payment status
• Download as PDF or share via link

The free tier includes 5 invoices/month - enough for many freelancers and consultants.

If you send invoices, I'd love your feedback: [Link]
